# Shinchan-making
This is a simple code in which we had drawn our favorite cartoon character Shinchan using turtle module in Python

How it Works :- 
1. Fork the repository
2. Open the code into any editor (we have used VS code)
3. Import the modules
4. Run the Python File
5. Boom you'll se how Shinchan is being built using Python's Turtle module.
